# vboard Releases

This repository is used solely to publish release assets for **vboard**.

## Downloading vboard

Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/syt-honey/vboard/releases) page to download the latest macOS/Windows installers and update manifests generated by our CI pipeline.

## Release Process

1. Changes are merged into the `main` branch of `vboard-prod`.
2. GitHub Actions builds the app and uploads artifacts to this repository’s releases.
3. The desktop app’s auto-updater reads update metadata (`latest.yml`, etc.) from these releases.

## Verifying Downloads

Each release includes checksums generated by `electron-builder`. You can verify an installer by running:

```bash
shasum -a 512 vboard-<platform>-<version>.<ext>
```

and comparing the hash with the value published alongside the asset.

## Reporting Issues

Encountered a bug or need help? Please open an issue in the main project repository once it is made public, or contact the maintainers directly.
